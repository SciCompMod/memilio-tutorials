# MEmilio C++ Tutorials

Here you can find C++ tutorials for some of MEmilio's models. 

To build the tutorials, you can execute the following commands in the `cpp-tutorials` folder. 

``` sh
mkdir build && cd build 
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j32
```

The executables can then be run from the `build` folder via 

``` sh
./bin/tutorial_ide
```
